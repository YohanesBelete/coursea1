    <div>
        <p> Hello, I am a 16 year old boy that wants to be a software engineer in the future and get paid a lot of money doing what i like, which is <b>coding</b></p>
        <p>The reason i like to code is because, the feeling you get from coding for hours and hours on your own 
            and getting the perfect result that you wanted to achive makes me so happy and want to do more of it.
        </p>
        <p>So I want to be a Software engineer not just cuz of the money I will get , but because of the joy and happiness i will get by coding and working on my dream job.</p>
        <div>
            <p>It all started when i was watching movies and looking at people typing fast and writing this cool looking codes and as any kid that watches those movies i wanted to 
                become like them. But i was legit into it so i went on Youtube and searched "how to hack". There were so many videos on how to get started on hacking but i realised that i have to download a code editor to start coding, but i can't do that because i was using my mom's phone back then. so i waited until i get my own pc or atleast phone.
                 I had my very own pc for the first time when i was 13, i was so happy and as i promised myself i went to that old Youtube video and downloaded "Visual studio" to get started with HTML.
                       </p>
                       

                    
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                 I was learning some basic HTML things on Khan Academy and learned some things like how to add images on a webpage, how to write a paragraph,...etc
                 Luckly while I was taking the course our IT teacher gave us an assignment which i making a website about the school. Ofcourse i was hyped and got to work quickly. Some of the students toke  pictures of the school and sent it to me and i added those pictures to the website. The website was looking good i thought it was a good idea to add some transtions on the home page and it was a good idea
                 . as the submission day arrives i was just focusing on the assignment and forgetting to study for the exam that was coming up and as i thought i scored a really bad grade. My mom was mad at me and said i nned to quit coding and i told her that i am coding because there is an assignment givent to us to make a website and my entire group members are counting on me. And on the submission day my website was looking clean and the teacher ended up give me and my group members a bonus.
                 this is the end of my coding carrer. Thank you if u stayed.
